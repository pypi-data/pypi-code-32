    Approach to flatten a nested sequence.
    Args:
        seq (iterable): iterable to be flattened
        containter (iterable): iterable defining an append method. Values will
            be appended there
        keep_types (list of type): types that should not be flattened but kept
            in nested form
    Examples:
        >>> from tfields.lib.util import flatten
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> flatten([[1,2,3],4,[[5,[6]]]])
